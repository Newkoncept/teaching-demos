# SimpleOOPDemo

A basic PHP project demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like classes, inheritance, constructors, and access modifiers.

This project was created as part of a practical OOP lesson to show how `protected`, `private`, and `public` properties behave, and how methods interact between parent and child classes.

## How to Set It Up

1. Place the `SimpleOOPDemo` folder inside your `htdocs` directory (if using XAMPP).
2. Start Apache from your XAMPP Control Panel.
3. In your browser, go to:
   http://localhost/SimpleOOPDemo/index.php
4. The output will be generated directly from the PHP class structure.

## Features

- Class declaration and inheritance
