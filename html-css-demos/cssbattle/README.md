# CSSBattle Single Page Design Challenges

This folder contains a series of single-page designs recreated from challenges on [CSSBattle.dev](https://cssbattle.dev/), a platform for improving visual CSS skills through creative code-based puzzles.

Each file in this collection represents a **faithful recreation of a specific CSSBattle challenge**, written with pure HTML and CSS â€” no JavaScript, images, or frameworks.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The aim of these mini-projects was to:
- Practice precision in visual layout and styling
- Improve CSS skills like positioning, sizing, layering, and color matching
- Reinforce a deep understanding of how HTML and CSS combine to form visuals
- Teach students how small pieces of code can produce pixel-perfect output

## ðŸ§± How to Run

1. Open any `.html` file in your browser.
2. View the static visual recreation of the corresponding CSSBattle target.
3. You can open the file in a code editor to study the CSS logic behind the layout.

## ðŸš€ What These Projects Cover

- Use of `position: absolute` and relative container control
- `border-radius`, `transform`, `z-index`, `box-shadow`, and `clip-path` techniques
- Color matching using hex values and background manipulation
- Alignment tricks using margins, Flexbox, or calculated units
- Writing minimal, clean HTML and CSS for visual output only

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- These are **visual-only pages** â€” no interactivity or responsiveness
- Built for exact match on **desktop resolution**, as CSSBattle targets are fixed-size canvases
- The designs may not use semantic HTML (intentionally minimal for precision control)

## ðŸ’¡ What Youâ€™ll Learn

- How to analyze a visual layout and break it down into CSS logic
- How to position elements with surgical precision
- How to work with shapes and layering using only CSS
- How constraints (no JS, no images) push creativity in frontend coding
