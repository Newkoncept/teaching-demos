# W3Schools Navbar Recreation (Desktop Version)

This project is a desktop-focused recreation of the main navigation bar from [W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com), built using only HTML and CSS. It closely mimics the look and structure of the original navbar to help students understand how large-scale, real-world layouts are implemented.

This version is designed specifically for desktop screens and does not include mobile responsiveness or collapsing behavior.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This project was created to teach students how to:
- Recreate a familiar website component from scratch
- Analyze and replicate real-world HTML/CSS structure
- Practice layout, spacing, and hover interactions

## ðŸ§± How to Run

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. You'll see a static navigation bar similar in layout and styling to W3Schoolsâ€™ main navbar.
3. Hover over the items to view hover effects (if implemented).

## ðŸš€ What This Project Covers

- Top navigation bar with evenly spaced links
- Hover effects and color transitions
- Use of `display: inline-block` or `position` for horizontal alignment
- Use of web-safe fonts and colors matching the W3Schools style

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- This project is for **desktop display only**.
- There is **no JavaScript** or dropdown functionality.
- It's a visual and structural clone for layout learning purposes.
