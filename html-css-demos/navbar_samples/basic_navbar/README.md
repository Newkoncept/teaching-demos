# Responsive Navbar with Collapse (HTML, CSS & JavaScript)

This project demonstrates a responsive navigation bar that includes a toggle/collapse feature for smaller screens. Built using HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript, it was used to teach responsive design patterns and interactivity in navbar behavior.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This version builds on the static navbar and introduces responsive logic with a collapsible menu, commonly seen in mobile-friendly websites.

It was designed to help students understand:
- How to hide/show nav links based on screen size
- How to trigger visibility using JavaScript

## ðŸ§± How to Run

1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser.
2. On smaller screens, the navigation links are hidden behind a toggle icon (hamburger).
3. Click the icon to reveal or hide the navigation menu.

## ðŸš€ What This Project Covers

- HTML structure for semantic navigation
- CSS media queries to shift layout on smaller screens
- JavaScript to toggle visibility (`classList.toggle()` pattern)
- Flexbox and positioning for alignment
- Responsive behavior with basic animations or transitions

## ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ll Learn

- How to build a responsive, interactive navbar
- How to hide/show elements using JavaScript
- How to apply media queries for layout changes
- How to organize HTML/CSS/JS in a real-world component
