# Bank Logo Recreation (HTML & CSS)

This project is a visual exercise where various bank logos were recreated using only HTML and CSS. The goal was to practice precision layout, typography matching, and styling accuracy without relying on image assets or JavaScript.

Each logo was manually built by referencing actual brand visuals and matching the look using pure frontend techniques.

## üöÄ What This Project Covers

- Pixel-accurate recreation of real-world bank logos
- Use of CSS properties like `flexbox`, `position`, `border-radius`, `transform`, and custom fonts
- Careful structuring of HTML for visual alignment and simplicity
- No images ‚Äî all logos are styled using CSS only

## üí° Purpose

This was built as a visual CSS challenge to improve skills in layout precision and creative styling. It was also used as a teaching example to show students how powerful CSS can be for replicating static visuals.

## üß± How to Run

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. All logos are visible directly on the page.
3. You can inspect individual sections in the browser to see how each logo was structured and styled.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Notes
