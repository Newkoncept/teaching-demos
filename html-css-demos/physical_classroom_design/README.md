# Learning Room Front Structure (HTML & CSS)

This project is a visual representation of the front section of our physical learning room, recreated using only HTML and CSS. It was built as a layout and structure practice to improve spatial thinking, alignment, and CSS styling skills.

The design includes elements like the whiteboard area, projector screen, instructor desk, and other recognizable items that form the front-facing layout of the classroom.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The goal of this project was to help visualize how real-world physical environments can be translated into structured HTML elements styled purely with CSS. This also served as a fun and educational way to blend spatial awareness with code-based layout skills.

## ðŸ§± How to Run

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. The layout will visually simulate the front of our classroom as viewed from the student seating area.
3. Use browser dev tools to inspect how each part of the room was positioned and styled.

## ðŸš€ What This Project Covers

- Use of `div` blocks to represent physical items (walls, board, screens, desk, etc.)
- Application of `flexbox`, `position`, `box-shadow`, and `border-radius` to shape the room
- Styling that mirrors real-world colors and layout proportions
- Absolute and relative positioning for spatial control

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- This project focuses on desktop layout only and is not responsive.
- All structures are static representations â€” there is no interactivity.
- It reflects the **general structure**, not exact dimensions.

## ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ll Learn

- How to visualize and recreate real environments using HTML/CSS
- How to break physical spaces into code-based components
- How positioning and layout systems work in CSS
- How to style non-traditional UI layouts for creative projects
