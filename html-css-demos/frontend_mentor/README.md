# Frontend Mentor Practice Projects (HTML & CSS)

This folder contains a collection of frontend practice projects inspired by challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). These projects were built primarily using HTML and CSS to sharpen layout and styling skills.

Each project was tackled with a desktop-first approach, focusing on clean structure, proper HTML semantics, and CSS layout techniques. Full responsiveness was intentionally left for students as part of a learning exercise.

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each subfolder inside this directory contains one project, typically including:
- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- Assets such as images or icons
- Designs (displays the expected look for each mobile screens)

Projects may vary in structure slightly depending on the challenge.

## 🔍 What These Projects Focus On

- Semantic HTML structure
- CSS layout techniques (Flexbox, Grid)
- Desktop-first design implementation
- Visual matching with design mockups
- Clean and readable code structure

## 🚫 What’s Not Included

- Full mobile responsiveness (left for student implementation)
- JavaScript interactivity (these are static layout challenges)

## 🧠 Intended Purpose

These projects served as practical layout and styling exercises, and also as starter templates for students to build upon. Students were encouraged to:
- Make the pages fully responsive
- Add animations or transitions
- Convert the layout into reusable components

## 🛠 How to View a Project

1. Open the desired project folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Use browser dev tools to test layout at different screen sizes.

## 💡 Tip for Students

If you're working through these projects:

- Start by identifying the main layout areas (e.g., header, content, footer).
- Try converting the CSS to mobile-first if you're comfortable with media queries.
- Use the design files (if provided) to understand the expected final look and layout.
- Test your layout using Chrome DevTools or tools like [Responsively App](https://responsively.app/) to preview across screen sizes.
