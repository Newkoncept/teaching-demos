# Facebook Login Page Clone (Responsive)

This project is a responsive recreation of Facebookâ€™s login page using only HTML and CSS. It mimics the structure, layout, and styling of the real login screen while adapting gracefully across screen sizes â€” from mobile to desktop.

Built for frontend practice and styled with CSS only, this project replicates the visual flow without any backend logic or interactivity.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The goal of this project was to sharpen skills in responsive layout design by replicating a widely recognized interface. It was also used to demonstrate how complex real-world layouts can be built using only HTML and CSS â€” no JavaScript or frameworks.

## ðŸ§± How to Run

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Resize the browser window or test on mobile to see the responsiveness.
3. Inspect elements to understand how flexbox, media queries, and layout strategies were applied.

## ðŸš€ What This Project Covers

- Pixel-accurate layout recreation using semantic HTML
- Responsive styling using CSS media queries
- Use of CSS Flexbox and fixed widths for layout control
- Font and color choices closely matching Facebookâ€™s UI
- Proper structure of form elements and spacing

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- This is a **frontend-only clone** â€” no form submission or account logic is included.
- The layout aims to match the visual style, not the full behavior of Facebook.
- Some design liberties were taken for educational clarity.

## ðŸ“± Responsive Features

- Two-column layout on desktop (illustration + form)
- Single-column stacked layout on mobile
- Text scaling and spacing adjustments for smaller screens
- Mobile-friendly button and input sizing

## ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ll Learn

- How to build a responsive login page from scratch
- How to use flexbox for layout alignment
