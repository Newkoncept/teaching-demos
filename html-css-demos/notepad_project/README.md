# Coding Without an IDE â€“ Notepad Practice Project

This project was created during a class exercise to demonstrate that **coding is not limited to fancy tools or full-featured IDEs**. We used **basic Notepad** (or any simple text editor) to build a working HTML/CSS project, reinforcing the idea that **the browser only reads the code â€” not the software it was written in**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The aim of this exercise was to:
- Remove intimidation around "big" IDEs and developer tools
- Show students they can start coding with the simplest resources
- Emphasize understanding of code syntax over tool features
- Encourage confidence and focus on foundational skills

## ðŸ§± How It Was Done

1. The project was written from scratch using **Notepad**.
2. `.html` files were manually saved using proper file extensions.
3. The browser was used to **open and preview** the results.
4. No auto-complete, color hints, or visual formatting â€” just raw, clean code.

## ðŸ“Œ What This Project Includes

- Basic HTML structure with semantic tags
- Clean, working output displayed in a web browser
- No frameworks, libraries, or IDE dependencies

## ðŸ’¡ Takeaway for Students

> Itâ€™s not about the tool â€” itâ€™s about what you understand and how you write it.

- IDEs make things easier, but they **donâ€™t replace knowledge**.
- Every developer should be comfortable writing raw HTML/CSS in a basic environment.
- This skill builds confidence and makes debugging easier later in larger environments.

## ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ll Learn

- How to handwrite and structure clean HTML and CSS
- How file extensions and linking work manually
- How to preview and test your work in the browser without any development environment
- That good code matters more than the software you use

âœ… This project helped students prove to themselves that **what matters most is their understanding, not the interface.**
