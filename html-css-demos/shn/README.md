# SHN Fashion Landing Page (Responsive Layout)

This is a fully responsive landing page designed using only HTML and CSS. The layout and styling are inspired by modern fashion brand websites and were developed to teach and practice key frontend concepts like flex layout, visual hierarchy, and minimal UI structure.

## ðŸ§  Project Purpose

The goal of this project was to demonstrate how to structure and style a complete hero section for a brand, focusing on:

- Typography and branding with HTML/CSS
- Layouts using Flexbox
- Background images and positioning
- Responsive behavior with vertical and horizontal alignment

## ðŸ§± How to Run

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
2. Make sure `style.css` and the image `img1.jpg` are in the same directory.
3. Resize the browser window to test responsiveness and layout flexibility.

## ðŸš€ What This Project Includes

- Responsive two-column layout using Flexbox
- Fullscreen hero section with heading, subtext, and CTA
- Vertical side navigation bar for social links
- Custom carousel button structure (non-functional visual)
- Floating image element for stylistic layering
- Background image set via CSS and `<img>` element for emphasis

## ðŸŽ¨ Styling Features

- Custom color palette with CSS variables
- Clean typography with strong brand hierarchy
- Use of `position: absolute` for layered effects (e.g. floating image, carousel)
- Vertical writing mode for the side nav bar (`writing-mode: vertical-lr`)

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- This is a **static layout**. The carousel controls are **non-functional**, included for design purposes only.
- Focus was on **desktop-first responsiveness** and layout exploration.
- The layout uses a real image (`img1.jpg`) for both background and foreground to demonstrate image layering.
