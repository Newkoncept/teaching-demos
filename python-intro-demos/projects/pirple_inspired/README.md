# Python Practice Projects â€“ Foundations Edition ðŸ§±

This folder contains a collection of beginner-to-intermediate level Python scripts focused on foundational programming concepts. The topics include loops, conditionals, lists, dictionaries, input handling, and functions â€” all demonstrated through practical examples like shopping systems, to-do apps, and favorite song metadata.

Each script is self-contained and serves as a building block for core Python skills.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This project was created to:

- Practice Python basics through real-world mini examples  
- Help learners understand how different data types and control flows work  
- Reinforce the use of functions, dictionaries, lists, and user input  
- Encourage modular and readable coding from the start  

## ðŸ§± How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.  
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in this project folder.  
3. Run any of the scripts individually using:

   ```
   python script_name.py
   ```

   Replace `script_name.py` with any of the following files.

## ðŸš€ Script Breakdown

### `basic_loops.py`
- Implements classic FizzBuzz (prints numbers 1â€“100 with conditions on 3 and 5)

### `advanced_loops.py`
- Draws a board/grid using a combination of `|`, `-`, and space characters
- Takes row and column values with validation

### `conditional.py`
- Checks whether a number is greater than or equal to any of two others
- Includes sample tests to demonstrate output logic

### `lists.py`
- A custom to-do list that tracks unique items
- Duplicates are stored in a separate `myLeftovers` list

### `dictionaries.py`
- Stores metadata for a favorite song in a dictionary
- Includes a guessing game for dictionary keys and values

### `function.py`
- Similar to `dictionaries.py` but uses modular functions to output values
- Demonstrates `global` keyword use and conditional evaluation

### `shopping.py`
- A shoe store inventory simulation using dictionary-based stock control
- Asks the user for shoe size input and updates inventory accordingly

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Inputs in `shopping.py` and `advanced_loops.py` are interactive â€” run them from terminal
- Lists and dictionaries are used heavily for practice
- All print statements are for educational demonstration

## ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ll Learn

- How to use `if-else` and `elif` logic in real programs  
- How to manipulate lists and avoid duplication  
- How to work with dictionaries as flexible data stores  
- How to define and call reusable functions  
- How to handle user input and validate data types
