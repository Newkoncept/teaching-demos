# Multiplication Table & Odd Number Generator (JavaScript Project)

This project displays the multiplication tables for numbers 1 through 15 and generates all odd numbers between 1 and 100. It was created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and is designed as a class teaching tool to demonstrate DOM manipulation, loops, and conditional logic.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The goal of this project was to help students:
- Understand how to dynamically generate and insert HTML elements with JavaScript
- Practice loops (`for` loop) and conditionals (`if`, `%` operator)
- Create multiple dynamic elements such as tables and spans
- Apply CSS styling to structured output

## ðŸ§± How to Run

1. Ensure the following files are in the same folder:
   - `sample.html` (main HTML file)
   - `script.js` or `sample.js` (choose one active script)
   - `style.css` for styling

2. Open `sample.html` in any web browser.
3. You'll see:
   - A full grid of multiplication tables for numbers 1â€“15
   - A highlighted section showing all odd numbers from 1 to 100

> **Note**: `sample.js` and `script.js` do similar tasks with different logic structures. Only one should be active at a time.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Dynamic creation of 15 multiplication tables (1â€“15 Ã— 1â€“20)
- Each table uses HTML `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>` structure
- Highlighted list of odd numbers from 1â€“100 using `<span>` elements
- Styled output for readability and visual learning

## ðŸ’¡ Learning Focus

- Working with JavaScript arrays and loops
- Generating HTML elements using `document.createElement()`
- Appending elements with `appendChild()` and `innerHTML`
- Conditional rendering using `if (x % 2 !== 0)`
- Applying basic CSS for tables and layout

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Responsive layout using `flex-wrap` to arrange tables in rows
- CSS includes visual emphasis for captions and odd numbers
- This project is purely frontend with no external dependencies

## ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ll Learn

- How to dynamically build and populate tables with JavaScript
- How to create and style repeating elements
- How to separate concerns between HTML, CSS, and JS
- How to structure simple learning-focused JavaScript exercises

This project is excellent for teaching **JavaScript basics**, especially DOM interaction, and makes a great classroom demonstration or beginner assignment.
