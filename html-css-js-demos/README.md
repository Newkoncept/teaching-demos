# JavaScript Projects Collection

This folder contains a variety of JavaScript-based projects created as part of hands-on learning, class demonstrations, and personal practice.

Many of these projects focus on **JavaScript logic, interactivity, and browser behavior** — including form handling, timers, games, calculators, storage, and DOM manipulation. Some designs and templates used here were sourced from online platforms or tutorials, with the goal of applying JavaScript skills in realistic and visually structured environments.

## 🎯 Purpose

This collection was built to:

- Practice key JavaScript concepts in real projects
- Reinforce learning through building and experimentation
- Provide practical reference code for teaching and reuse
- Explore how JavaScript brings static layouts to life

> ⚠️ Some HTML/CSS templates were adapted from online sources or tutorials — the focus here was intentionally on **JavaScript functionality**, not custom frontend design.

## 📁 What’s Inside

- Class-based mini apps (e.g., budget tracker, insurance quote tool)
- Form validators and calculators
- Games like the Pig Dice Game
- UI interactivity demos (e.g., color switchers, clocks)
- Storage-based projects using `localStorage`
- Projects done as exercises following YouTube, blog, or tutorial guidance

Each project is self-contained and includes its own `README.md` where applicable.

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

- How to build functional UIs with vanilla JavaScript
- How to manage user input, state, and events
- How to simulate real-world features like carts, forms, and games
- How to interact with the browser using the DOM and Web APIs

## 📌 Notes

- All projects are frontend only (no server-side code unless noted)
- Code quality and complexity may vary depending on the learning stage at the time
- You’re welcome to use, remix, or extend these projects as learning tools

This folder is both a personal learning archive and a growing JavaScript reference toolkit.
