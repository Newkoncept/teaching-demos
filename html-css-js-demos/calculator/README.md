# JavaScript Calculator

This is a fully functional calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with a simple, interactive interface.

This project was developed as part of a JavaScript fundamentals class, focusing on real-world logic implementation, DOM manipulation, and dynamic user interaction.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The goal of this project was to help students:

- Understand how to use JavaScript to capture user input
- Learn how to store and manage values and operations
- Manipulate the DOM to display results dynamically
- Combine logic with UI design to create functional tools

## ðŸ§± How to Run

1. Make sure the following files are in the same folder:
   - `index.html`
   - `style.css`
   - `script.js`
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. Use the calculator to perform operations just like a physical calculator.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Real-time input display using `onclick` events
- Handles chained operations (e.g., `3 + 2 * 4`)
- Live calculation preview
- Display history of entered values and operators
- Reset (`C`) button to clear the calculator
- Responsive design for smaller screen widths

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Uses vanilla JavaScript â€” no libraries or frameworks
- Numbers are limited to a maximum of 11 digits for readability
- Results are rounded to 1 decimal place if a floating point is detected
- Includes basic mobile responsiveness

## ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ll Learn

- How to build a calculator from scratch using JavaScript
- How to handle user input and store values in variables
- How to use `innerText` and conditional logic to control the interface
- How to apply JavaScript functions to build a workflow from input to result
- Basics of mobile responsiveness using media queries

This is a solid foundational project for students looking to move from simple JavaScript logic into creating fully interactive, browser-based applications.
