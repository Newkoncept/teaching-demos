# Date of Birth & Age Generator (JavaScript)

This is a simple JavaScript-powered web app that allows users to calculate either their age or their date of birth based on the input they provide. The interface is clean, user-friendly, and focused on reinforcing concepts around forms, conditional rendering, and basic math operations in JavaScript.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This project was created to help students learn:

- How to work with multiple HTML forms and conditionally display them
- How to use JavaScript to dynamically calculate and update content
- How to apply DOM manipulation and handle user input
- How to structure a simple form-based user experience

## ðŸ§± How to Run

1. Make sure the following files are in the same directory:
   - `index.html`
   - `style.css`
   - `app.js`
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. Choose whether to enter your **age** or your **date of birth** using the dropdown.
4. Submit your input and view the generated result.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Option to choose between entering your age or year of birth
- Calculates either the corresponding birth year or current age
- Dynamically updates the UI with the result
- Uses `Date()` to get the current year
- Forms are shown or hidden dynamically based on user selection

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Input fields expect only numeric values
- Validation is minimal (only checks for empty fields)
- Works for users born in the modern era (e.g., valid 4-digit years)
- Built with **vanilla JavaScript**, no libraries used

## ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ll Learn

- How to use `addEventListener` with forms
- How to conditionally display content using class toggling
- How to get the current year in JavaScript
- How to structure clean HTML/CSS forms for simple utilities

This is a great beginner-friendly project to practice real-world use cases of JavaScript, and a useful class example for teaching **form handling and conditional logic**.
