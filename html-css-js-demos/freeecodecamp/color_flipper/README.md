# Color Flipper (Simple & Hex Mode)

This is a fun and interactive web-based color flipper that changes the background color of the page when a button is clicked. It offers two modes: one that selects from a list of named colors and another that generates random HEX color codes.

The project was built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and is inspired by a FreeCodeCamp project idea to help learners understand DOM manipulation, event handling, and working with color formats.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The goal of this project is to teach:

- How to update styles dynamically with JavaScript
- How to generate random values (for color picking)
- How to switch UI behavior based on navigation selection
- How to handle user interaction with clean, responsive design

## ðŸ§± How to Run

1. Make sure the following files are in the same folder:
   - `index.html`
   - `style.css`
   - `app.js`

2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Use the **Simple** or **Hex** tab to toggle color mode.
4. Click the **"Click Me"** button to change the background color and display the selected value.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Two modes:
  - **Simple**: chooses from an array of CSS named colors
  - **Hex**: generates random 6-character hexadecimal color codes
- Updates both the background and the displayed color text
- Active tab highlighting for mode selection
- Responsive, centered layout with smooth transitions

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

- HTML5 (semantic structure)
- CSS3 (styling and layout)
- Vanilla JavaScript (event handling and logic)

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- The default mode is **Simple** on page load.
- The project is self-contained â€” no external libraries or frameworks required.
- Color mode selection persists as long as the page remains open.

## ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ll Learn

- How to query and modify DOM elements with JavaScript
- How to handle click and load events
- How to create color generation logic using `Math.random()`
- How to update content and styles dynamically in response to user interaction

This is a great mini project for beginners looking to build something visual, interactive, and extendable with pure JavaScript.
