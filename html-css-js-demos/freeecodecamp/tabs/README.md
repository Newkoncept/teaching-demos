# Tabbed About Section (JavaScript Tabs)

This project is a responsive "About" section that uses tabbed navigation to display content dynamically. Built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, the layout allows users to click tabs labeled History, Vision, or Goals to toggle between different content blocks â€” with only one visible at a time.

The purpose of this project is to help learners practice DOM manipulation, class toggling, and responsive design. When a tab is clicked, it activates the corresponding content section by updating the DOM with a `.show` class and visually marking the selected tab as `.active`.

To run the project, place the following files in the same folder: `index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js`, and `image.jpg`. Then open `index.html` in your browser. Click between the tabs to see the content swap instantly. The layout uses Flexbox for a side-by-side design on desktop, and stacks the content vertically on smaller screens. The image on the left is hidden on screens narrower than 500px.

This is a great project for anyone learning how to build clean tabbed components without libraries or frameworks, and is ideal for use in portfolio sections, FAQs, product features, or any section-based content.
