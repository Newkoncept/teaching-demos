# Giveaway Countdown Timer

This project is a countdown timer interface designed for a promotional giveaway. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to show the time remaining until a predefined end date. The project includes an image, product description, and a real-time updating timer displaying days, hours, minutes, and seconds remaining.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to use JavaScript to calculate the difference between the current time and a future date, then dynamically update that information in the DOM every second. It also reinforces the use of flexbox for layout, media queries for responsiveness, and class-based DOM selection for updating content.

To run the project, make sure the following files are in the same folder: `index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js`, and the image file `image.jpg`. Then open `index.html` in a browser. The timer will update automatically every second and stop when the countdown reaches zero. The layout adjusts for smaller screens using a mobile-friendly column layout.

The project uses modern JavaScript features like `setInterval()` and `Date` object methods. Note that the current implementation includes console logs for debugging and uses a static date (`expected_date`) for demonstration purposes. You can adjust the `expected_date` in `app.js` to target a real future date.

This is a great beginner-level JavaScript project for learning how to build dynamic UI elements that update with time and interact with the DOM in real-time.
