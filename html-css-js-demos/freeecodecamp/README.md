# FreeCodeCamp Project Ideas Collection

This folder contains multiple frontend and JavaScript-based projects built by following project ideas, challenges, and walkthroughs from **FreeCodeCamp**.

Each subfolder includes a different project inspired by FreeCodeCamp’s curriculum — ranging from beginner to intermediate difficulty — and was used as a practical way to apply concepts such as layout design, DOM manipulation, event handling, and data processing.

## 🎯 Purpose

The projects in this folder were developed to:

- Reinforce lessons from the FreeCodeCamp platform
- Practice turning ideas into working applications
- Build a stronger understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Learn by doing — through challenge-based, hands-on work

## 📁 What’s Included

- Each folder represents a standalone project idea from FreeCodeCamp
- Some follow the original design and logic closely, while others include additional modifications or experiments
- Projects focus primarily on **JavaScript functionality**, with some light styling for clarity

## ✅ Technologies Used

- HTML & CSS (basic layout and styling)
- JavaScript (core logic, interactivity, and DOM handling)
- No frameworks or libraries unless explicitly included in the project

## 📌 Notes

- These are **learning-based builds**, not production apps
- Layouts and styles may vary depending on the lesson or source inspiration
- Attribution: Project ideas and structures are based on open and educational content provided by [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org)

This folder serves as a practice space and learning archive built around the FreeCodeCamp journey — feel free to explore or build upon these projects.
