# Background Video Toggle Project

This project is a simple yet elegant web page featuring a full-screen background video with toggle controls to play or pause the video. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it showcases how to create immersive video backgrounds while still giving the user basic control.

The interface includes a bold “Video Project” heading layered over the video and two toggle buttons — “Play” and “Pause.” When clicked, the active button highlights while controlling the video playback in real time. The styling ensures the video fills the screen and sits behind all content with smooth overlay effects.

To run the project, ensure the following files are in the same folder: `index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js`, and a `video.mp4` file. Open `index.html` in any modern browser. The video will autoplay on load, muted and looped. Use the bottom toggle to pause or resume playback. All logic is handled via class-based DOM manipulation.

This project is excellent for practicing how to control media using JavaScript, and how to layer content using CSS positioning. It’s ideal for splash pages, product backgrounds, or homepage hero sections.
