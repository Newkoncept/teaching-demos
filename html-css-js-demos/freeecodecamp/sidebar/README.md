# Sidebar Toggle Navigation (JavaScript)

This project is a responsive sidebar navigation menu that toggles visibility when a hamburger icon is clicked. The sidebar appears from the left and displays a vertical list of navigation links. It also includes a close icon to hide the sidebar again. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

The purpose of this project is to help learners understand how to use JavaScript for toggling classes to show/hide UI elements, how to structure semantic navigation using lists, and how to apply responsive layout and positioning using modern CSS techniques.

To run the project, make sure the following files are in the same directory: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `app.js`. Then open `index.html` in your browser. Clicking the hamburger icon (≡) will slide in the sidebar. Clicking the close icon (⌧) will slide it back out. The toggle is handled by JavaScript, which adds or removes the `.show` class to the `.navbar` element.

This layout uses a fixed header with a flex-based `nav` bar, styled with clean modern fonts and colors. The sidebar appears as a vertical menu fixed on the left side of the screen and covers the full height of the viewport. Styling is minimal and mobile-friendly, designed to teach functionality over visuals.

This project is a great exercise for beginners learning how to build mobile navigation systems and interactive layouts using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks involved.
