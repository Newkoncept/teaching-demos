# JavaScript Counter App

This is a simple counter application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to increase, decrease, or reset a number displayed on the screen. It’s an interactive beginner-friendly project designed to teach DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive styling.

When a button is clicked, the counter value updates in real time. The number color also changes based on the count: green for positive, red for negative, and black for zero.

To run this project, place the following files in the same folder: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `app.js`. Then open `index.html` in a browser. The three main buttons — Increase, Decrease, and Reset — will control the counter’s state.

The JavaScript code uses `addEventListener` to handle button clicks, updates the counter’s value and color, and modifies the text content of the `.counter` element. The styling is done using basic CSS with color-coded buttons and responsive layout using Flexbox.

This project is perfect for learners practicing how to link JS logic with HTML elements and create interactive browser-based tools.
