# Responsive Hamburger Navigation Menu

This project is a simple and clean implementation of a responsive navigation menu using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It features a mobile-style hamburger icon that toggles a full-screen overlay menu, allowing users to navigate between sections.

The main goal of this project was to help students understand how to create a modern navigation menu experience using basic web technologies, focusing on layout structure, toggling visibility, and interaction feedback.

When the hamburger icon (☰) is clicked, a full-screen nav menu appears. Clicking the close icon (⍩) hides the menu again. JavaScript handles the toggling of a `.show` class that reveals or hides the `.sass` container, which holds the navigation links. Flexbox is used to center and stack the links vertically in mobile view.

To run this project, make sure the following files are in the same folder: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `app.js`. Then open `index.html` in your browser. Click the hamburger icon to open the nav menu, and click the close button to collapse it.

This is a useful and reusable structure for building responsive nav menus in real-world websites or single-page applications, with no frameworks required. All styles are written in CSS, and the logic is fully handled using plain JavaScript.
