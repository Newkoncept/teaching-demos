## 🧠 About This Repository

During my time teaching at NIIT and other volunteer initiatives, I led over 100 students through structured training in:

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES5)
- PHP and MySQL (CRUD apps, basic auth)
- Introductory Python (scripts and logic)
- Full-stack concepts and real-world simulations

These projects were designed to demonstrate:

- **Frontend fundamentals**: structure, styling, interactivity  
- **Backend basics**: forms, data handling, database CRUD  
- **Practical workflows**: login systems, CMS clones, student projects  
- **Security intro**: input validation, POST/GET handling, session control

While the projects reflect their era (2021–2022), they continue to serve as strong examples of technical instruction, clarity, and mentorship in action.

## 📚 Instructional Style

Each project was:

- ✅ Built live during class or used as a code walkthrough
- ✅ Refactored into clear, teachable steps
- ✅ Documented with inline comments and logic flow

## 📝 Notes

- This is an **archived repository** — no active development is planned.
- Code reflects **beginner to intermediate** skill level (for instructional use).
- All demos were originally written in VSCode on Windows/Linux environments.

## 🎓 Outcome

> Many of my students from this teaching period went on to pursue BSc programs, entry-level tech roles, or advanced training in software development.

This repo stands as part of my legacy in tech mentorship — bridging the gap between foundational learning and professional readiness.
